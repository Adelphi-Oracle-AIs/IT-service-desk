3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set up environment variables for database connection and secret key
6. Run the application: `python run.py`

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Deployment

This application is designed to be compatible with various cloud platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. Specific deployment instructions will vary based on the chosen platform.

For demonstration purposes, the frontend can be deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. Add `"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>"` to `package.json`
2. Install gh-pages: `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`
